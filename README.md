# Covid-19-Data-Analysis_Project_Using-Python

This project involves analyzing Covid-19 data using Python. The analysis was performed in Jupyter Notebook and focuses on exploring trends, visualizing key metrics, and extracting insights from two datasets: **covid_vaccine_statewise** and **covid_19_india**.

## Project Objective

The main goals of this project are:
- To analyze and visualize the spread of Covid-19 in India.
- To explore vaccination trends across states in India.
- To gain insights from the data that can help understand the pandemic's impact.

## Datasets

1. **covid_vaccine_statewise.csv**
   - Contains data related to Covid-19 vaccinations across Indian states.
   - Includes columns such as state names, vaccination dates, doses administered, and demographic details.

2. **covid_19_india.csv**
   - Provides data on Covid-19 cases in India.
   - Includes columns such as date, state names, confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths.


## Tools and Technologies

The project was developed using:
- **Jupyter Notebook** for coding and analysis.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data cleaning and manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.


## Key Features of the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values were handled, and irrelevant columns were removed.
   - Data types were converted for better computation.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - State-wise and date-wise analysis of Covid-19 cases.
   - Insights into active, recovered, and fatal cases.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Growth trends of Covid-19 cases over time.
   - State-wise vaccination progress using bar plots and line graphs.
   - Correlation between vaccination rates and active cases.

4. **Insights**:
   - Identified states with the highest and lowest vaccination rates.
   - Observed patterns in the decline of active cases with increased vaccinations.
